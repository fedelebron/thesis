\section{Valid inequalities}

In order to help an ILP solver find an optimal solution to our formulation we develop the following families of valid inequalities, meant as part of a branch-and-cut algorithm.

Given what we know about chance inequalities, the dimension of the polytope will not be easy to compute, in general. Thus whether or not these inequalities are facet-defining is something we will not be able to prove, since the dimension of the polytope itself will be unknown. However, these inequalities were all obtained by looking at small instances, doing vertex enumeration with the zerOne program\cite{Bussieck:1998:VSS:302316.302321}, doing facet enumeration via the Fourier-Motzkin transform with the PORTA program\cite{PORTA}, and extrapolating from the instance facets to generally valid families of inequalities. Thus at least in those cases, some of the inequalities were facet-defining by construction, and we suspect that they are strong, in general. For more information on the facet and vertex enumeration procedures, see appendix \ref{app:facets}.
