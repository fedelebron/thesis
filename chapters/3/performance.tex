\section{Performance}

We can analyze the model in terms of its performance when fed to CPLEX, an ILP solver. We analyse the runtime in terms of the different variables of the problem.

In figure~\ref{bench:courses} we see its behavior when we vary the number of courses, leaving all else constant. We see a linear growth when the number of courses is small, below 50.
